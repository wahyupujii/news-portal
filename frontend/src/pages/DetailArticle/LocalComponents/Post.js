                Jakarta, 25 June 2021 -  Mutual Fund selling agent PT Buka Investasi Bersama (“BIB”), a subsidiary of Bukalapak, which in December 2020 forged a strategic partnership with PT Ashmore Asset Management Indonesia Tbk (“Ashmore”), has formally launched the BMoney investment app. 

                BMoney’s tagline “Cuan Jadi Gampang” underlines its ambition to become the easy, fast, and secure investing platform available to everyone. BMoney prioritizes online security and transaction safety while providing convenience with a minimum subscription of Rp1,000, under five minutes registration time, no transaction fee, and portfolio management available 24/7. 

                BMoney’s technology innovation delivers an easy and transparent investment experience, including its Robo Advisory and Insight feature that provides users with market-related information prior to making an investment decision, and the ability for users to monitor and manage their portfolios online anytime and anywhere.
